Mario is a system used to test virtual machines' performance using benchmark and specific metric you set. In our system, Mario can normally test VM/PM CPU metric, IO metric, memory metric, network metric and a [Juno]() workflow test.

In this system, there're two roles: users and administrator. User can execute Mario-support test, add evaluated PM/VM and submit test case to the administrator. Administrator must finish the test script.
